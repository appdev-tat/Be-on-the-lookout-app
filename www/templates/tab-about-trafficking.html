    <h3 class="page-title">About human trafficking</h3>

    <p>Human trafficking is the exploitation of human beings for the purposes of forced labor or commercial sex. Traffickers use <strong>force, fraud and coercion</strong> to control their victims and make a profit off of their labor. Human trafficking is, indeed, modern-day slavery.</p>
    
    <p>Trafficking can occur in many locations, including <strong>bus terminals, restaurants, hotels/motels, strip clubs, casinos, private homes, truck stops, rest stops</strong>, etc. Moreover, traffickers recruit victims out of bus terminals and utilize the bus itself to transport their victims. Whether you work behind a ticket counter, conduct bus maintenance, or are a professional driver, members of the bus industry are in a position to spot potential human trafficking situations and save a life.</p>
