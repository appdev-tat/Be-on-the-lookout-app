      "liz": "<p>\"My trafficking story started when I was six years old. From six to 18, my mom sold me to men in our community. When it came to my school life, it's where I excelled. School was the only safe place I had. I used to sleep in the library at school because it wasn't safe to sleep at home or I wasn't able to sleep because there were men in my bedroom at night.</p>\n\n<p>Going to elementary and high school, I rode a school bus. I went to a local Catholic school and I actually had the same driver for the entire duration of my school career. I think he saw things that didn't quite add up and didn't make sense. My bruises, my scars, telling him that I was clumsy and that I fell off my bike. He had the opportunity to observe the comings and goings from my house. Who was there to put me on the bus in the morning and who was there to pick me up at night? I would just tell him, \"Oh, my uncle's here,\" and get off the bus.</p>\n\n<p>I think that one of the biggest assets that a school bus driver would have is the rapport that they can build with another human being who trusts them to get them from point A to point B, and to keep them safe while they do it. Building that rapport means treating them like a human being and noticing the normal details, and the not so normal. If it was a hundred degrees out, you would notice someone who came in with a turtleneck and long pants. And you would wonder, what are they hiding underneath the turtleneck? What is the reason for their clothing?</p>\n\n<p>I truly believe that knowledge is what's going to make the difference. If you see something, you can say something. It's going to be that one small act that changes everything for a survivor. If the only thing you do is become trained and knowledgeable and understand that human trafficking even happens. So many people actually think it's a myth. I'm here to tell you that I lived it. I survived it, and no other human being should have to go through it.\"</p>\n\n<p><em>- Survivor Leader Liz Williamson</em></p>"

      "california": "<p>Not long after the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System rolled out its anti-human trafficking program—which included the BOTL video—their transit security personnel made note of a man at one of their transit centers acting aggressively toward a young woman. When the same man later returned to the transit center and was seen approaching other young women, transit officers shared their suspicions and evidence with the San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force which coordinated with other law enforcement agencies in California. The investigation culminated in the arrest of the man at a motel near Los Angeles where he and an accomplice were holding a young woman against her will.</p>",
      "newYork": "<p>A law enforcement officer in New York City was called to the scene by a bus driver who was concerned for the welfare of two teenage girls who were in a restricted area of the bus terminal. The girls, who looked dirty and disheveled, had been begging for a free trip to Pennsylvania and one of the girls supposedly offered one driver sex in exchange for a ride. After getting them some pizza and spending some time talking with the girls in his office, the officer learned that the girls were cousins and before they ended up on the street, they’d been living with and working for the one of the girl’s “boyfriend” and his mother—in a house that was used as a massage parlor in which they were forced to provide sexual services. When the girl confronted her pimp/”boyfriend” about another girl he’d started sleeping with, the mother kicked her and her cousin out, maintaining control of all of their money and belongings. The case was promptly referred for further investigation, and the officer got the girls to safety. Following the investigation, the mother and son trafficking team was arrested, and the other victims at the brothel, including several minors, were recovered.</p>",
      "ohio": "<p>A Lakefront Lines bus driver in Ohio was approached by a young woman on his bus who told him that she was being held against her will and forced into prostitution by a male passenger on the same bus. The driver—who had recently completed the BOTL training—notified dispatch and the Lakefront Lines safety team immediately sprang into action and got law enforcement on the scene. As more details of their circumstances were revealed, the young woman was connected to resources and the alleged perpetrator was arrested.</p>",
      "washington": "<p>One week after a transit agency in Washington State showed the BOTL training video at a monthly staff safety meeting, an emotionally distraught young woman came into their transit center. She had severe bruising on her face and abrasions all over her body. An employee approached the young woman to see if she needed help. The employee learned that she had just been released from the hospital after being beaten, raped and robbed. She revealed information that suggested she was a victim of sex trafficking. She didn’t know what city she was in, had no phone and no money. She’d come to the transit center to find transportation to a friend who she believed was safe. The employee helped her contact the friend and got her a bus ticket. The employee and colleagues then pooled the cash they had in their own wallets to make sure the young woman had some money with her as she traveled.</p>"
